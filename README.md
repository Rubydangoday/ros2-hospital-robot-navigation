# Autonomous Multi-Goal Navigation for Hospital Robot

Autonomous robot system powered by ROS2, designed to operate within hospital 
environments and perform navigation tasks across multiple rooms in an optimized sequence.

Unlike basic navigation systems that only handle a single destination, this system 
addresses the more complex **multi-goal navigation problem**, analogous to the 
Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), where the primary objective is to minimize 
the total travel distance/time.

## Features

- **Multi-point Navigation:** Handles multiple destinations with an optimized sequence.
- **Route Optimization:** Utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the sequence planning.
- **Realistic Cost Calculation:** Uses actual path costs from Nav2 instead of simple Euclidean distance.
- **Automatic Re-planning:** Dynamically adjusts the plan when encountering obstacles or unreachable goals.
- **Hospital Simulation:** Includes a detailed simulation environment with complex rooms and corridors.
- **Dashboard (GUI):** Supports goal selection and real-time system monitoring.
